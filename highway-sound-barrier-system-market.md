<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Highway Sound Barrier System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective Sound Barrier</li><li>Composite sound Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Highway Sound Barrier System market consists of two main types: reflective sound barriers and composite sound barriers. Reflective sound barriers are designed to bounce sound waves away from sensitive areas, effectively reducing noise pollution from traffic. These barriers are typically made from solid materials like concrete or metal. Composite sound barriers, on the other hand, combine different materials, such as acoustic panels and absorptive substances, to both reflect and absorb sound, providing enhanced noise reduction and aesthetic options for urban environments.</p></p>
