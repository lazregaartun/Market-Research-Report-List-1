<p><strong>The Titanium Nitride Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)</li><li>Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Titanium Nitride (TiN) coating is applied using two primary methods: Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD). CVD involves the chemical reaction of gaseous precursors to form a thin TiN layer on a substrate, offering uniform coatings over complex geometries. In contrast, PVD utilizes physical processes, such as sputtering or evaporation, to deposit TiN atoms onto surfaces, resulting in dense and high-quality coatings. Both methods are essential for enhancing wear resistance, reducing friction, and improving tool performance in various applications.</p></p>
