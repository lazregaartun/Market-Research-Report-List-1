<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Resorbable Lifting Thread Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Notched</li><li>Smooth</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The resorbable lifting thread market is primarily divided into two types: notched and smooth threads. Notched threads feature small indentations that enhance grip within the tissue, providing secure lifting and tightening effects that can stabilize more significant tissue sagging. In contrast, smooth threads lack these notches, offering a subtler lift with less trauma to the surrounding tissue, making them ideal for delicate areas. Both types are designed for aesthetic procedures, gradually dissolving over time while promoting natural collagen production.</p></p>
